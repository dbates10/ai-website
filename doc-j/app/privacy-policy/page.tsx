          <strong>Effective Date: 12/21/2023</strong>
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-bold mt-4">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p className="m-4">
          Welcome to Doc J&apos;s Laboratory. We are committed to respecting the
          privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
          use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our
          website docjslab.com, including any other media form, media channel,
          or mobile website related or connected thereto (collectively, the
          “Site”). Please read this privacy policy carefully.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-bold mt-4">2. Collection of Your Information</h2>
        <p className="m-4">
          We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The
          information we may collect on the Site includes:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-8 list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Personal Data</strong>
            <br />
            Personally identifiable information, such as your name, email
            address, and telephone number, that you voluntarily give to us when
            you choose to participate in various activities related to the Site,
            such as newsletter subscriptions or filling out contact forms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Derivative Data</strong>
            <br />
            Information our servers automatically collect when you access the
            Site, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system,
            access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and
            after accessing the Site.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Financial Data</strong>
            <br />
            Financial information, such as data related to your payment method
            (e.g., valid credit card number, card brand, expiration date) that
            we may collect when you purchase, order, return, exchange, or
            request information about our services from the Site. We store only
            a very limited portion of your purchase transaction data. All
            transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not
            stored or processed on our servers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="font-bold mt-4">3. Use of Your Information</h2>
        <p className="m-4">
          Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a
          smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use
          information collected about you via the Site to:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-8 list-disc">
          <li>Administer sweepstakes, promotions, and contests.</li>
          <li>Confirm eligibility for loyalty programs</li>
          <li>

            information regarding promotions and the Site to you.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="font-bold mt-4">4. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
        <p className="m-4">
          We may share information we have collected about you in certain
          situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-8 list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>By Law or to Protect Rights</strong>
            <br />
            If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to
            respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential
            violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and
            safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or
            required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation. This includes
            exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection and
            credit risk reduction.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="font-bold mt-4">5. Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p className="m-4">
          We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to
          help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable
          steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be
          aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or
          impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed
          against any interception or other type of misuse.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-bold mt-4">6. Policy for Children</h2>
        <p className="m-4">
          We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to individuals
          under the age of 21. If you become aware of any data we have collected
          from individuals under age 21, please contact us using the contact
          information provided below.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-bold mt-4">
          7. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features
        </h2>
        <p className="m-4">
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a
          Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal
          your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
          activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
          recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such,
          we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
          mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
          tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we
          must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
          revised version of this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
